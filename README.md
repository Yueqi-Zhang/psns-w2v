Word2vec-PyTorch
====

This is the implementation of word2vec based on PyTorch.

Run it with

python word2vec.py data/test/zhihu.txt data/test/wvect_test.txt data/test/cvect_test.txt data/test/ps_0.01_test.pkl data/test/ns_0.01_test.pkl data/test/emb.txt


I write a [blog](https://adoni.github.io/2017/11/08/word2vec-pytorch/) about the word2vec based on PyTorch.
